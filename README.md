# Lab - 4: Mapping Through Tiles Generation
In this lab, the goal is to generate four tile sets of any geographic phenomena we are interested in. 
The first tile set should be a base map provided by MapBox.
The second tile set should be a thematic layer made by our own geospatial dataset.
The third tile set should be a layer group that is composed of a thematic layer (from the second tile set) and a basemap from the first tile set
The fourth tile set should be a map layer designed over Mapbox. It should embody a map theme relevant to our research interests.
